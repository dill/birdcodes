One-word Names: first 6 letters of the name (ex. Redhead = REDHEA; Osprey = OSPREY; Sora = SORA)

Two-word Names: first three letters of first word and first three letters of last word.  Hyphenated words always treated as separate words (ex. Common Yellowthroat = COMYEL; Storm-petrel = STOPET; Painted Redstart = PAIRED)

Three-word Names: two letters from first word, one from second, three from third:Blue-winged Warbler = BLWWAR; Wilson’s Storm-petrel = WISPET; Dark-eyed Junco = DAEJUN)

Four-or-more-word Names:  one letter from each first three words, then first three letters of last word (ex. Great black-backed Gull = GBBGUL; Black-throated Blue Warbler = BTBWAR; Yellow-crowned Night Heron = YCNHER)

Some similar-color names are abbreviated in fixed ways: green is GRN or GN; gray is GRY or GY; black is BLK or BK; blue is BLU or BU; and brown is BRN or BN (Brown-crested Flycatcher = BNCFLY; Black-throated Green Warbler = BTGNWA; Black-throated Gray Warbler = BTGYWA)

Note that four of the nine collisions in the 6-letter code scheme occur in the warbler group, specifically Blackpoll/Blackburnian (BLPOWA/BLBUWA), Black-throated Green/Black-throated Gray (BTGNWA/BTGYWA), Pallas’ Warbler (an old world vagrant to Alaska)/Palm Warbler (PALLWA/PALMWA) and Golden-cheeked/Golden-crowned (GOCWAR/GOCRWA).
